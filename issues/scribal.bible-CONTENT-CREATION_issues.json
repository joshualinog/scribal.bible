Is it a difficult task because it creates cognitive dissonance in the one who is entrenched and trying to determine if their own normal is in fact harmful? \n\n\n","comments":[],"createdAt":"2025-10-14T19:48:14Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOMaqE1s8AAAABr-NFOA","name":"﹖.ᐣ❔🔎 🕵🏻 QUESTION","description":"Further information is requested","color":"444BD4"},{"id":"LA_kwDOMaqE1s8AAAACBzXYkg","name":"🌐🔭 Torah Geography | Mapping Realia","description":"","color":"FF210D"},{"id":"LA_kwDOMaqE1s8AAAACPIjhJQ","name":"isPost","description":"Issue represents a post","color":"ffffff"}],"number":277,"state":"OPEN","title":"Understanding sociological normalization over generations","updatedAt":"2025-11-07T21:14:42Z"},{"assignees":[{"id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4Mzk2MDM=","login":"joshualinog","name":"Joshua Andrew Linog"},{"id":"U_kgDOCpZ1iw","login":"TonyLinog","name":""},{"id":"U_kgDOCpo9eg","login":"RGuido4","name":""},{"id":"U_kgDOCsNH3A","login":"leighlinog","name":""},{"id":"U_kgDODH-zLA","login":"joemshea","name":""},{"id":"U_kgDODJkvRA","login":"kmccummings","name":""}],"body":"# What is the relationship(s) between memorialization and prayer?\n","comments":[],"createdAt":"2025-10-13T18:03:59Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOMaqE1s8AAAACB_PssQ","name":"🛐🙏🏾🤲🏾🙌🏾 PRAYER","description":"","color":"A74CFC"},{"id":"LA_kwDOMaqE1s8AAAACB_P9yA","name":"👨🏻‍🔬🧬🙏🩸🕊️ THE SCIENCE OF PRAYER | PRAY = SACRIFICE","description":"","color":"A74CFC"},{"id":"LA_kwDOMaqE1s8AAAACLgw9bg","name":"Memorializing  |  shema beauty & door decorations","description":"","color":"4ED149"},{"id":"LA_kwDOMaqE1s8AAAACLgxQ9Q","name":"Stord wealth & memorialization | mind husband male","description":"","color":"A74CFC"},{"id":"LA_kwDOMaqE1s8AAAACLgxdsA","name":"Remember!

More than that, I even consider all things to be loss because of the surpassing greatness of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, for the sake of whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and consider them dung, in order that I may gain Christ and may be found in him, not having my righteousness which is from the law, but which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness from God on the basis of faith, so that I may know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings, being conformed to his death, if somehow I may attain to the resurrection from the dead.\n\nMat 10:37-39 LEB The one who loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me, and the one who loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me. And whoever does not take up his cross and follow me is not worthy of me. The one who finds his life will lose it, and the one who loses his life because of me will find it.\n\n1Co 8:2-3 LEB If anyone thinks he knows anything, he has not yet known as it is necessary to know. But if anyone loves God, this one is known by him.\n\n1Co 8:5-6 LEB For even if after all there are so-called gods, whether in heaven or on earth, just as there are many gods and many lords, yet to us there is one God, the Father, from whom are all things, and we are for him, and there is one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things, and we are through him.\n\n1Co 8:2-6 LEB If anyone thinks he knows anything, he has not yet known as it is necessary to know. But if anyone loves God, this one is known by him. Therefore, concerning the eating of food sacrificed to idols, we know that \"an idol is nothing in the world\" and that \"there is no God except one.\" For even if after all there are so-called gods, whether in heaven or on earth, just as there are many gods and many lords, yet to us there is one God, the Father, from whom are all things, and we are for him, and there is one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things, and we are through him.\n\nPsa 28:1-2 LEB A psalm of David. To you, O Yahweh, I call. O my rock, do not be deaf to me. Or else, if you are silent to me, then I will become like those descending to the pit. Hear the voice of my supplications when I cry to you for help, when I lift up my hands toward your holy inner sanctuary.\n\nPsa 63:1-3 LEB A psalm of David, when he was in the wilderness of Judah. O God, you are my God; I will seek you diligently. My soul thirsts for you; my flesh longs for you as in a dry and weary land without water. Thus I have seen you in the sanctuary, beholding your strength and glory. Because your loyal love is better than life, my lips will praise you.\n\nPsa 63:3 LEB Because your loyal love is better than life, my lips will praise you.\n\nPsa 101:1-2 LEB Of David. A psalm. I will sing of loyal love and justice; I will sing praises to you, O Yahweh. I will give attention to the way of integrity. When will you come to me? I will walk in the integrity of my heart in the midst of my house.\n\nMat 3:16-17 LEB Now after he was baptized, Jesus immediately went up from the water, and behold, the heavens opened and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove coming upon him. And behold, there was a voice from heaven saying, \"This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased.\"\n\nMat 4:1-4 LEB Then Jesus was led up into the wilderness by the Spirit to be tempted by the devil, and after he had fasted forty days and forty nights, then he was hungry. And the tempter approached and said to him, \"If you are the Son of God, order that these stones become bread.\" But he answered and said, \"It is written, 'Man will not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes out of the mouth of God.\"\n\nDeu 8:1-5 LEB \"All of the commandments that I am commanding you today you must diligently observe, so that you may live and multiply, and you may go and take possession of the land that Yahweh swore to your ancestors. And you shall remember all of the way that Yahweh your God led you during these forty years in the desert in order to humble you and to test you to know what is in your heart, whether you would diligently keep his commandments or not. And he humbled you and let you go hungry, and then he fed you with that which you did not know nor did your ancestors know, in order to make you know that not by bread alone but by all that goes out of the mouth of Yahweh humankind shall live. Your clothing did not wear out on you, and your feet did not swell during these forty years. And you should know with your heart that as a man disciplines his son, so Yahweh your God is disciplining you.\n\nDeu 10:12-13 LEB And now, Israel, what is Yahweh your God asking from you, except to revere Yahweh your God, to go in all his ways and to love him and to serve Yahweh your God with all your heart and with all your soul, to keep the commandments of Yahweh and his statutes that I am commanding you today for your own good.\n\nEph 5:18-20 LEB And do not be drunk with wine (in which is dissipation), but be filled by the Spirit, speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and singing praise in your heart to the Lord, giving thanks always for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to the God and Father,\n\nJos 1:6-9 LEB Be strong and courageous, for you will give the people this land as an inheritance that I swore to their ancestors to give them. Only be strong and very courageous to observe diligently the whole law that Moses my servant commanded you. Do not turn aside from it, to the right or left, so that you may succeed wherever you go. The scroll of this law will not depart from your mouth; you will meditate on it day and night so that you may observe diligently all that is written in it. For then you will succeed in your ways and prosper. Did I not command you? Be strong and courageous!

Is the apostle John depicting the word as the chief Shabbat director causing man and God to meet? Is this on purpose as a cosmological meeting time and meeting director and joiner? \n\nThis could explain why John places this designation of yeshua as the light at the beginning of his gospel and in his prologue in particular. This could explain the initial demonstration of the ordered rationale of the structure of the whole gospel being sacred sabbaths and sacred meeting times honing in on Jerusalem and the temple.\n\nI have known for a long time that John's structure is calendrical or based on the sacred Sabbath calendar. I have known that John depicts yeshua's movements according to the sacred calendar and high holy days and sabbaths in connection to the Jerusalem Temple. What is new is that John may be using the title of Jesus the light as the director of the sacred times because John may be wanting us to see titling Jesus as the light as titling Jesus as the one who directs the meeting times the light in Genesis 1:14. This is why in Genesis 1 it describes the first thing being structured as the light but when the light which is structured is enumerated in verse 14 it shows that it's purpose is for the meeting times. John begins his gospel with a relaying and a retelling and reordering of Genesis 1 centered on yeshua. This could be explaining why he does that out of all the titles that yeshua may hold, John is specifically showing yeshua as the light the one who directs the meeting times vis-a-vis the meetings between man and God.\n\n## prologue passages\n\nJoh 1:4-5 YLT 4 In him was life, and the life was the light of men, 5 and the light in the darkness did shine, and the darkness did not perceive it.\n\nJoh 1:7-9 YLT 7 this one came for testimony, that he might testify about the Light, that all might believe through him; 8 that one was not the Light, but--that he might testify about the Light. 9 He was the true Light, which doth enlighten every man, coming to the world;\n\n## More John thinking on the subject from John writings \n\nJoh 12:35-36 YLT 35 Jesus, therefore, said to them, 'Yet a little time is the light with you; walk while ye have the light, that darkness may not overtake you; and he who is walking in the darkness hath not known where he goeth; 36 while ye have the light, believe in the light, that sons of light ye may become.' These things spake Jesus, and having gone away, he was hid from them,\n1Jn 1:5 LEB And this is the message which we have heard from him and announce to you, that God is light and there is no darkness in him at all.\n1Jn 1:7 LEB But if we walk in the light as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus his Son cleanses us from all sin.\n\n## questions\n- [ ] does John have a more Torah Moses centered reason for employing the title The light, and applying that title to Yeshua as the messiah in particular, the promised Moses successor? \n- [ ] if so does John have a more Torah Moses centered reason for employing the title the word, and applying that title to Yeshua as the Messiah in particular, the promised Moses successor? Is this more is this more Torah centered reason for employing the title The word, actually the Torah, the law itself?

Each had six wings: with two he covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew. 3 And the one called to the other and said,  “Holy, holy, holy is Yahweh of **hosts** ARMIES!  The whole earth is full of his glory.” 4 And the pivots of the thresholds shook from the sound of those who called, and the house was filled with smoke.\n- 1 Corinthians 14:40 LEB But let all things be done decently and according to proper procedure.\n- Numbers 1:18-20 LEB 18 and they summoned the entire community on the first day of the second month. And they registered themselves among their clans according to their families, according to the number of names from those twenty years old and above individually, 19 just as Yahweh commanded Moses. And he counted them in the desert of Sinai. 20 The descendants of Reuben, the firstborn of Israel, their genealogies according to their clans, according to their families, according to the number of names, every male individually from twenty years old and above, everyone who is able to go to war:\n- 1 Corinthians 11:10 LEB Because of this, the woman ought to have a symbol of authority on her head, on account of the angels.\n     - scope of inclusion: inclusion of insiders & outsiders / inclusion of genders male and female / inclusion of ages down to small children (טף )  [who can walk and be instructed {as witnesses} and learners of the Torah ]\n- create a gathering order (and environment) that facilitates, causes/executes/performs [auditorially] hearing [ obeying ] the Torah [ that is read out loud]\n- create a gathering order (and environment) that facilitates, causes/executes/performs KNOWING [ intimately joining oneself] to [ the written and heard ] Torah [being read and explained]\n- \n\n### judgements / directives \n- [ ] the point of the contribution circle for contributing participants is maintaining a vigil of love and causing that love to manifest and build up the body that is presently circled \n- [ ] the only contributing participant that isn't maintaining a vigil of Love at a given point, and this still could be aimed for, is the contributing participant who is training a witness participant. \n- [ ] if you are not keeping the vigil there is no point in you being a part of the contributing circle.\n- [ ] no one should be made to come to the conclusion or to feel that they have to BOTH perform their duty as a contributing participant keeping vigil AND nursing and caring for non-witnesses because of Shadow/reflection duty at the same time. \n- [ ] likewise, the inverse of this, no one should come to the conclusion or be made to feel that they are in fact performing BOTH of these duties. If you are tending to and nursing and caring for non-witnesses that you have reflection duty towards, you are not ministering to intending to the substance duty of keeping vigil and contributing as an agent of heaven. You can't do both. \n- [ ] this is not an attack on either. This will speak to the necessity of making the overflow play necessarily richly diverse space of exchange. Sharpening an arrow that is a non witness is an incredible joy and a holy endeavor. We need to make this the explicit aim of parents who have non-witnesses. We need to make it open to share these goals and AIMS in the burden of them with housemates and anyone else who willingly wants to share and participate. \n- [ ] the overflow space is not arranged at a group level. It is a space that is provided for individuals to move in and out of according to their own discretion and responsibility. \n- [ ] a child that is a non-witness and cannot be trained to be a witness need not be present in the build-up circle. They should not be quarantined, silenced, cajoled, restricted as they have no share or benefit that can result from this time. It is not fair to them.","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOMaqE1s7I0GPk","author":{"login":"joshualinog"},"authorAssociation":"OWNER","body":"# Self policing and self disqualifying \n- [ ] a parable saying : don't throw the game!

Since the wonder with the water in this place was now to become a permanent feature as long as they would be in the wilderness, as our Rabbis have said, this was why the Divine Glory was revealed upon it at this place, just as it says concerning the manna, And in the morning, then ye shall see the Glory of the Eternal, since it remained a continuous wonder.\n\nhttps://www.sefaria.org/Ramban_on_Exodus.17.6.1\n\nהנני עומד לפניך שם על הצור בחורב.  הצור הזה שברפידים הוא הסלע שבקדש הכל אחד והוא היה בארה של מרים והלך כל ימי המדבר עמהם וזהו שאמר לשון הנני כלשון האמור במן הנני ממטיר לכם ללמד כשם שהמן עמד לישראל ארבעים שנה כן עמד הבאר הזה, ועוד כי כשם שנגלית שכינה במן שנאמר וראיתם, את כבוד ה' כן נגלית בכאן על הצור לבאר כי היה ענין הבאר פלא קיים כפלא המן.\nהנני עומד לפניך שם על הצור בחורב, “here I shall stand in front of you there by the Chorev (mountain).” This rock at Refidim was the same rock which we encounter almost 40 years later at Kadesh. This was also the source of the well of Miriam which traveled with the Israelites through the desert during all those years (compare Bamidbar Rabbah 1,2). The very word הנני used by G’d prior to the rock erupting in a well was the same as that used by G’d prior to releasing the manna from heaven. Just as the manna became a daily feature for the remainder of their trek through the desert until Moses’ death, so the well which appeared here for the first time became the Israelites’ constant companion at least until the death of Miriam. Furthermore, just as the giving of the manna had been preceded by a revelation of G’d’s glory (16,7), so the miracle of the rock erupting as a well was also preceded by a revelation of the glory of G’d seeing it was an ongoing miracle just as was that of the manna (compare Nachmanides).\n\nhttps://www.sefaria.org/Rabbeinu_Bahya,_Shemot_17.6.1\n\nבַּיּוֹם הַשְּׁבִיעִי וגו', הֲדָא הוּא דִכְתִיב

I will pay…” (Job 41:3). Rabbi Tanḥum ben Rabbi Abba said: One who has no property but performs acts of charity and kindness; one who has no children but pays the wages of Bible teachers and Mishna teachers; one who does not have a house but prepares a mezuza , one who has no garment but prepares ritual fringes; one who has no sons but circumcises; one who prepares books and lends them to others, the Holy One blessed be He says: This one preceded and fulfilled My mitzvot before I provided him with the means to fulfill them; I must pay, give him money and children who will read these books. That is, “Who preceded Me” – to perform a mitzva; and I will pay his reward. Why? It is because I lack nothing, as the world and all its contents are Mine. That is why it is stated: “Everything beneath the heavens is Mine” (Job 41:3). Another matter: “Who preceded Me? I will pay” (Job 41:3) – it is speaking of Abraham, who recognized the Holy One blessed be He on his own, just as it is written: “A wayward [sug] heart will be sated from its ways…” (Proverbs 14:14).What is, “a wayward heart will be sated from its ways”? Rabbi Abba bar Kahana said: It is a heart that is filled with dross [sigim]; it is destined to be sated because of its ways. “But a good man will be above him” (Proverbs 14:14) – this is Abraham, who recognized the Holy One blessed be He on his own. There was no person who taught him how to recognize the Holy One blessed be He; rather he did so on his own. This is one of four people who recognized the Holy One blessed be He on their own. Job recognized the Holy One blessed be He on his own; from where is it derived? It is as it says: “From my practice I treasured the sayings of His mouth” (Job 23:12). Hezekiah king of Judah, too, recognized the Holy One blessed be He on his own; from where is it derived? It is as it is written in his regard: “He will eat butter and honey, by his knowledge, spurning the bad and choosing the good” (Isaiah 7:15). The messianic king recognized the Holy One blessed be He on his own. Likewise, Abraham, the Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘The upper world and the world below are Mine,’ just as it says: “Everything beneath the heavens is Mine” (Job 41:3), and it says: “The earth and all its contents are the Lord’s” (Psalms 24:1). ‘You caused My name to be known in the world; as you live, I will grant you the upper world and the world below, as it is stated: “He blessed him, and he said: Blessed is Abram to God, the Most High, Master of heaven and earth” (Genesis 14:19). That is, “who preceded Me? I will pay.” Why? It is because “everything beneath the heavens is Mine.” Another matter: “Who preceded Me? I will pay” (Job 41:3) – Rabbi Elazar ben Rabbi Ḥiyya said: Everything that Abraham performed for the ministering angels, the Holy One blessed be He repaid his descendants upon their exodus from Egypt, and He is destined to give them in the future. You find regarding Abraham: “Please, let a little water be taken” (Genesis 18:4). The Holy One blessed be He, too, repaid his descendants: “I will take you for Me” (Exodus 6:7) – corresponding to “Please, let [a little water] be taken.” Rabbi Yoḥanan said: I have derived only regarding this world, regarding the future, from where is it derived? “The peoples will take them and bring them to their place” (Isaiah 14:2). Regarding Abraham it is written: “A little water,” and the Holy One blessed be He provided water for his descendants upon their exodus from Egypt: “You shall strike the rock, and water will emerge from it” (Exodus 17:6). Regarding the future, from where is it derived? “For the Lord your God is bringing you to a good land, a land of streams of water…” (Deuteronomy 8:7). Regarding the Messianic Era, from where is it derived? “There will be pools and streams of water on every lofty mountain and on every high hill” (Isaiah 30:25). Likewise, “I will open rivers on the bare hills” (Isaiah 41:18). Regarding Abraham it is written: “Wash your feet” (Genesis 18:4). The Holy One blessed be He granted it to his descendants upon their exodus from Egypt: “I washed you in water” (Ezekiel 16:9). And in the Land of Israel: “Wash, purify yourselves” (Isaiah 1:16). Regarding the future, from where is it derived? “When the Lord will have washed [the excrement of the daughters of Zion]” (Isaiah 4:4). Regarding Abraham it is written: “And recline beneath the tree” (Genesis 18:4), as he crafted a booth [sukka] for them. The Holy One blessed be He crafted booths for his descendants upon their exodus from Egypt: “That I had the children of Israel dwell in booths [basukot], [when I took them out of the land of Egypt]” (Leviticus 23:43). In the Land of Israel: “You shielded [sakota] my head on the day of battle” (Psalms 140:8). What is “the day of battle? It is the day of the arming of the thirty-one kings. Regarding the future, from where is it derived? “And a booth [sukka] will be for shade in the day…” (Isaiah 4:6). That is, “who preceded Me? I will pay…”(Job 41:3). Likewise it says: “Cast your bread upon the water, for after many days [you will find it]” (Ecclesiastes 11:1). Another matter: “Who preceded Me? I will pay” (Job 41:3) – it is speaking of Joseph, as he preceded and observed the Shabbat before it was given: “Slaughter an animal and prepare it” (Genesis 43:16). Rabbi Yoḥanan said: It was the day before Shabbat. “And prepare” is nothing other than for Shabbat, as it is stated: “It will be on the sixth day, they shall prepare…” (Exodus 16:5). The Holy One blessed be He said: Joseph, you observed the Shabbat before the Torah was given, as you live, your descendant will present his offering on Shabbat, when an individual does not present an offering. But it is incumbent upon Me to readily accept his offering. That is, “who preceded Me? I will pay.” From where is it derived that this is so? It is from what is stated regarding this matter: “On the seventh day, prince of the children of Ephraim…”\n\nhttps://www.sefaria.org/Bamidbar_Rabbah.14.2","comments":[],"createdAt":"2025-09-06T18:35:31Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOMaqE1s8AAAACB_P9yA","name":"👨🏻‍🔬🧬🙏🩸🕊️ THE SCIENCE OF PRAYER | PRAY = SACRIFICE","description":"","color":"A74CFC"},{"id":"LA_kwDOMaqE1s8AAAACFH_ozg","name":"Glory Name Face OF YAH / Visible | Earthly YAH","description":"Glory of | Name of | Face  | Visible | Earthly Yahweh","color":"f413a7"},{"id":"LA_kwDOMaqE1s8AAAACPIjhJQ","name":"isPost","description":"Issue represents a post","color":"ffffff"}],"number":238,"state":"OPEN","title":"A local revelation of the glory of God associated with a sustenance providing miracle or sign (water) ","updatedAt":"2025-11-07T21:13:46Z"},{"assignees":[{"id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4Mzk2MDM=","login":"joshualinog","name":"Joshua Andrew Linog"},{"id":"U_kgDOCpZ1iw","login":"TonyLinog","name":""},{"id":"U_kgDOCpo9eg","login":"RGuido4","name":""},{"id":"U_kgDODH-zLA","login":"joemshea","name":""},{"id":"U_kgDODJkvRA","login":"kmccummings","name":""},{"id":"U_kgDODKZ3JQ","login":"psammis87","name":""}],"body":"Exodus 16:13\nHB2 16:13 וַיְהִי בָעֶרֶב וַתַּעַל הַשְּׂלָו וַתְּכַס אֶת־הַמַּחֲנֶה וּבַבֹּקֶר הָיְתָה שִׁכְבַת הַטַּל סָבִיב לַמַּחֲנֶה:\nYLT And it cometh to pass in the evening, that the quail cometh up, and covereth the camp, and in the morning there hath been the lying of dew round about the camp,\nLEB And so it was, in the evening, the quail came up and covered the camp, and in the morning, a layer of dew was all around the camp.\n\n\nוַהֲוָה בְּרַמְשָׁא וּסְלִיקוּ פִּיסְיוֹנִין וַחֲפוֹי יַת מַשְׁרִיתָא וּבְצַפְרָא הֲוָת אֲנָחַת טַלָּא מִתְקַדְּשָׁא מִיתַקְנָא הֵי כְּפָתּוּרִין חֲזוֹר חֲזוֹר לְמַשְׁרִיתָא\nAnd it came to pass, that in the evening the pheasants came up and covered the camp;

Buchler restoring order of sedarim \n\nA. Büchler has restored the order of the sedarim on the assumption that the reading of the Law was commenced on the 1st of Nisan and continued for three years, and he has found that Genesis would be begun on the 1st of Nisan, Deuteronomy on the 1st of Elul, Leviticus on the 1st of Tishri, and Exodus and Numbers on the 15th of Shebaṭ, the four NewYears given in the Mishnah (R. H. i. 1). Nisan has always been regarded as the ecclesiastical NewYear. This arrangement would account for many traditions giving definite dates to Pentateuchal occurrences, the dates being, strictly speaking, those of the Sabbaths on which the lessons recording the occurrences are read. Thus, it is declared that the exodus from Egypt took place on Thursday, the 15th of Nisan (\"Seder 'Olam,\" x.), and the passage relating to the Exodus was read on that day. The slaying of the Passover lamb is said to have occurred on the 10th of Nisan, and is described in Ex. xii. 21, the passage read in the triennial cycle on the second Sabbath of Nisan, which would be the 10th where the 15th fell on Thursday. This likewise explains the tradition that the Israelites encamped at Rameses on a Sabbath, the 17th of Nisan, on which Ex. xii. 37 would be read in the triennial cycle. The tradition that Rachel was remembered on New-Year's Day (R. H. 10b) is due to the fact that in the first year of the cycle the sidra Gen. xxx. 22, beginning, \"And God remembered Rachel,\" would be read on Rosh ha-Shanah. As the reading of Deut. xxxiv. would occur on the 7th of Adar, there would be four remaining Sabbaths to be filled in before the new triennial cycle, which began with Nisan. Four special Sabbaths, Sheḳalim, Zakor, Parah, and Ha-Ḥodesh, still occur in Adar. Including these and the festival parashiyyot, and possibly also the special sedarim for Ḥanukkah and Purim, eleven extra divisions would be obtained, making up the 166 or 167 of the Yemen Bible.","createdAt":"2025-08-10T15:51:29Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/joshualinog/scribal.bible-CONTENT-CREATION/issues/222#issuecomment-3172728864","viewerDidAuthor":true},{"id":"IC_kwDOMaqE1s69HDT4","author":{"login":"joemshea"},"authorAssociation":"COLLABORATOR","body":"🤯","createdAt":"2025-08-10T16:12:34Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/joshualinog/scribal.bible-CONTENT-CREATION/issues/222#issuecomment-3172742392","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDOMaqE1s69HKpt","author":{"login":"joshualinog"},"authorAssociation":"OWNER","body":"![V12p256a01.jpg](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/90f59339-e999-48ec-ad0e-433eb1cf097a)\n\n","createdAt":"2025-08-10T17:08:20Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/joshualinog/scribal.bible-CONTENT-CREATION/issues/222#issuecomment-3172772461","viewerDidAuthor":true}],"createdAt":"2025-08-04T21:30:43Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOMaqE1s8AAAABr-NFOA","name":"﹖.ᐣ❔🔎 🕵🏻 QUESTION","description":"Further information is requested","color":"444BD4"},{"id":"LA_kwDOMaqE1s8AAAAB8WjfFA","name":"🏹➵𖦏📜 TORAH","description":"","color":"5319e7"},{"id":"LA_kwDOMaqE1s8AAAAB-5dXbQ","name":"what is the bible?","description":"","color":"6A4A5C"},{"id":"LA_kwDOMaqE1s8AAAAB_Ba4FA","name":"Public Reading","description":"","color":"FF210D"},{"id":"LA_kwDOMaqE1s8AAAAB_0INBQ","name":"➵𖦏TORAH - practicing  dry runs drills Playbook","description":"","color":"444BD4"},{"id":"LA_kwDOMaqE1s8AAAAB_0IdMA","name":"Bible study","description":"","color":"444BD4"},{"id":"LA_kwDOMaqE1s8AAAACFG6QNA","name":"Israel according to the flesh |  the Jewish people","description":"1 Corinthians 10:18 LEB Consider Israel according to the flesh:","color":"9376cd"},{"id":"LA_kwDOMaqE1s8AAAACPIjhJQ","name":"isPost","description":"Issue represents a post","color":"ffffff"}],"number":222,"state":"OPEN","title":"Trying to reconstruct the sedarim of the first century synagogue triennial cycle ( is there overlap with the Babylonian annual parashot ? )","updatedAt":"2025-11-07T21:13:22Z"},{"assignees":[{"id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4Mzk2MDM=","login":"joshualinog","name":"Joshua Andrew Linog"},{"id":"U_kgDOCpZ1iw","login":"TonyLinog","name":""},{"id":"U_kgDOCpo9eg","login":"RGuido4","name":""},{"id":"U_kgDOCsNH3A","login":"leighlinog","name":""},{"id":"U_kgDOCyhwNg","login":"titawensi","name":"Rency Denue"},{"id":"U_kgDOCyhyiQ","login":"thebattmaker","name":""},{"id":"U_kgDODH-zLA","login":"joemshea","name":""},{"id":"U_kgDODJkvRA","login":"kmccummings","name":""},{"id":"U_kgDODKZ3JQ","login":"psammis87","name":""}],"body":"- Do we know our children's souls?\n- Do we know our children's hearts? \n- Have we reached our fill of knowing our children's souls? \n- Have we reached our fill of knowing our children hearts?\n- does it satisfy us to know our children's hearts? \n- does it satisfy us to know our children's souls? \n- can we teach the shema to our children if we don't know their soul?

For instance, a traditional Haftarah for Genesis 16, the story of Sarah and Hagar, is Isaiah 54:1-10, God’s eschatological promise of bring joy to the childless:\n\n“Sing, barren woman,\nyou who never bore a child;\nburst into song, shout for joy,\nyou who were never in labor;\nbecause more are the children of the desolate woman\nthan of her who has a husband,”\nsays the Lord. Isaiah 54:1\n\nIn Galatians 4, we find Paul using Sarah and Hagar’s story in his discussion, and then pulling in Isaiah 54 at the end.

Going out again about the sixth and ninth hour he did the same thing. 6 And about the eleventh hour he went out and found others standing there and said to them, ‘Why are you standing here the whole day unemployed?’ 7 They said to him, ‘Because no one hired us.’ He said to them, ‘You go also into the vineyard.’ 8 And when evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his manager, ‘Call the workers and pay them their wages, beginning from the last up to the first.’ 9 And when the ones hired about the eleventh hour came, they received a denarius apiece. 10 And when the first came, they thought that they would receive more, and they also received a denarius apiece. 11 And when they received it, they began to complain against the master of the house, 12 saying, ‘These last people worked one hour and you made them equal to us who have endured the burden of the day and the burning heat!’ 13 But he answered one of them and said, ‘Friend, I am not doing you wrong.

This is the regulation of the infectious skin disease.”\n\n\n\nLeviticus 15:1 Then Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,\n\n\n\nLeviticus 15:2 “Speak to the Israelites, and you shall say to them, ‘Any man when a fluid discharge occurs from his body, his fluid discharge is unclean.\n\n\n\nLeviticus 15:3 And this becomes his uncleanness in his fluid discharge: whether his body secretes his fluid discharge or his body blocks his fluid discharge, it is his uncleanness.\n\n\n\nLeviticus 15:4 Any bed upon which the person who discharges lies down becomes unclean, and any object upon which he sits becomes unclean.\n\n\n\nLeviticus 15:5 And anyone who touches his bed must wash his garments and shall wash himself with water, and he shall be unclean until evening.\n\n\n\nLeviticus 15:6 And the person who sits on the object upon which the person who discharges has sat must wash his garments, and he shall wash himself with water, and he shall be unclean until the evening.\n\n\n\nLeviticus 15:7 And the person who touches the body of the person who discharges must wash his garments, and he shall wash himself with water, and he shall be unclean until the evening.\n\n\n\nLeviticus 15:8 And if the person who discharges spits on one who is clean, then that one shall wash his garments, and he shall wash himself with water, and he shall be unclean until the evening.\n\n\n\nLeviticus 15:9 And any saddle upon which the person who discharges rides becomes unclean.\n\n\n\nLeviticus 15:10 And any person who touches anything that happened to be under him becomes unclean until the evening, and the person who carries them must wash his garments, and he shall wash himself with water, and he shall be unclean until the evening.\n\n\n\nLeviticus 15:11 And anyone whom the person who discharges might touch without rinsing off his hands with water shall wash his garments, and he shall wash himself with water, and he shall be unclean until the evening.\n\n\n\nLeviticus 15:12 But a clay vessel that the person who discharges touches must be broken, and any wood object must be rinsed with water.\n\n\n\nLeviticus 15:13 “ ‘And when the person who discharges becomes clean from his body fluid discharge, he shall count for himself seven days for his cleansing; then he shall wash his garments, and he shall wash his body with fresh water, and he shall be clean.\n\n\n\nLeviticus 15:14 Then on the eighth day he shall take for himself two turtledoves or two young doves, and he shall come before Yahweh at the tent of assembly’s entrance, and he shall give them to the priest.\n\n\n\nLeviticus 15:15 And the priest shall sacrifice one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering, and so the priest shall make atonement for him before Yahweh from his body fluid discharge.\n\n\nGOSPEL READING\nMatthew 17:14-18:14\n(28 verses)\n\nMatthew 17:14 And when they came to the crowd, a man approached him, kneeling down before him\n\n\n\nMatthew 17:15 and saying, “Lord, have mercy on my son, because he has seizures and suffers severely, for often he falls into the fire and often into the water.\n\n\n\nMatthew 17:16 And I brought him to your disciples, and they were not able to heal him.”\n\n\n\nMatthew 17:17 And Jesus answered and said, “O unbelieving and perverse generation! How long will I be with you? How long must I put up with you? Bring him here to me!”\n\n\n\nMatthew 17:18 And Jesus rebuked him, and the demon came out of him and the boy was healed from that hour.\n\n\n\nMatthew 17:19 Then the disciples approached Jesus privately and said, Why were we not able to expel it?”\n\n\n\nMatthew 17:20 And he said to them, “Because of your little faith. For truly I say to you, if you have faith like a mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, ‘Move from here to there,’ and it will move, and nothing will be impossible for you.”\n\n\n\nMatthew 17:22 Now as they were gathering in Galilee, Jesus said to them, “The Son of Man is going to be betrayed into the hands of men,\n\n\n\nMatthew 17:23 and they will kill him, and on the third day he will be raised.” And they were extremely distressed.\n\n\n\nMatthew 17:24 Now when they arrived in Capernaum, the ones who collected the double drachma tax came up to Peter and said, “Does your teacher not pay the double drachma tax?”\n\n\n\nMatthew 17:25 He said, “Yes.” And when he came into the house, Jesus spoke to him first, saying, “What do you think, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth collect tolls or taxes—from their own sons, or from foreigners?”\n\n\n\nMatthew 17:26 And when he said, “From foreigners,” Jesus said to him, “Then the sons are free.\n\n\n\nMatthew 17:27 But so that we do not give offense to them, go out to the sea, cast a line with a hook, and take the first fish that comes up. And when you open its mouth, you will find a four-drachma coin. Take that and give it to them for me and you.”\n\n\n\nMatthew 18:1 At that time the disciples came up to Jesus, saying, “Who then is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?”\n\n\n\nMatthew 18:2 And calling a child to himself, he had him stand in their midst\n\n\n\nMatthew 18:3 and said, “Truly I say to you, unless you turn around and become like young children, you will never enter into the kingdom of heaven!\n\n\n\nMatthew 18:4 Therefore whoever humbles himself like this child, this person is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven,\n\n\n\nMatthew 18:5 and whoever welcomes one child such as this in my name welcomes me.\n\n\n\nMatthew 18:6 But whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it would be better for him that a large millstone be hung on his neck and he be drowned in the depths of the sea.\n\n\n\nMatthew 18:7 Woe to the world because of causes for stumbling, for it is a necessity that causes for stumbling come; nevertheless, woe to the person through whom the cause for stumbling comes.\n\n\n\nMatthew 18:8 And if your hand or your foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it from you! It is better for you to enter into life crippled or lame than, having two hands or two feet, to be thrown into the eternal fire!\n\n\n\nMatthew 18:9 And if your eye causes you to sin, tear it out and throw it from you! It is better for you to enter into life one-eyed than, having two eyes, to be thrown into fiery hell!\n\n\n\nMatthew 18:10 “See to it that you do not despise one of these little ones, for I tell you that their angels in heaven constantly see the face of my Father who is in heaven.\n\n\n\nMatthew 18:12 What do you think? If a certain man has a hundred sheep, and one of them wanders away, will he not leave the ninety-nine on the hills and go and look for the one that wandered away?\n\n\n\nMatthew 18:13 And if he happens to find it, truly I say to you that he rejoices over it more than over the ninety-nine that did not wander away.\n\n\n\nMatthew 18:14 In the same way it is not the will of your Father who is in heaven that one of these little ones perish.","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOMaqE1s6sKY1P","author":{"login":"joshualinog"},"authorAssociation":"OWNER","body":"> Leviticus 14:45 So he shall break down the house, its stones and its wood and all of the house’s plaster, and he shall bring it all outside the city to an unclean place.\n\n**outside the city to an unclean place**\n# basis of valley of Hinnom","createdAt":"2025-05-17T13:44:54Z","includesCreatedEdit":true,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/joshualinog/scribal.bible-CONTENT-CREATION/issues/125#issuecomment-2888404303","viewerDidAuthor":true},{"id":"IC_kwDOMaqE1s6sKZ6x","author":{"login":"joshualinog"},"authorAssociation":"OWNER","body":"# חרשׂ\nStrong's Definition: A collateral form mediating between H2775 (חרסה חרס) and H2791(חרשׁ); a piece of pottery: - earth (-en), (pot-) sherd, + stone.\n![SmartSelect_20250517_095750_MySword for Android.jpg](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/246bea86-e065-4d63-b155-3e8340a423de)\n\n![SmartSelect_20250517_095925_MySword for Android.jpg](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4ee786c1-aae1-4acc-939a-ff6086470c76)\n![SmartSelect_20250517_100327_MySword for Android.jpg](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/242e236b-15c3-40a8-ad99-d02f840c5c76)\n\n\n\n\n\n","createdAt":"2025-05-17T13:53:12Z","includesCreatedEdit":true,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/joshualinog/scribal.bible-CONTENT-CREATION/issues/125#issuecomment-2888408753","viewerDidAuthor":true}],"createdAt":"2025-05-17T13:42:57Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOMaqE1s8AAAAB_Ba4FA","name":"Public Reading","description":"","color":"FF210D"},{"id":"LA_kwDOMaqE1s8AAAACPIjhJQ","name":"isPost","description":"Issue represents a post","color":"ffffff"}],"number":125,"state":"OPEN","title":"Weekly Public Reading\n5/17/25\nLeviticus 14:33 - 15:15\n40 verses\nGOSPEL\nMatthew 17:14-18:14\n28 verses\nTazria-Metzora","updatedAt":"2025-11-07T21:10:50Z"},{"assignees":[{"id":"U_kgDOCpZ1iw","login":"TonyLinog","name":""},{"id":"U_kgDOCpo9eg","login":"RGuido4","name":""}],"body":"It is the LIE. It is the lie in Ephesians 4. It doesn't matter if they are fully committed to the role of playing the role of the LIE, it is still the LIE, there is still the truth, there is still the real them. The real them is summoned out of the tomb by the voice of Yeshua. If they obey his voice if they are taught by him and hear his voice they will walk as and cause others to experience the truth created in Messiah Yeshua, the real them.\n\nI can detect it's not who they really are by merit of knowing what love is. Love has no fear in it. Love is not arrogant. Love is not angry. So when I see arrogance as a relational configuration, I know I'm not dealing with love, I know there is fear, I know there is masking, I know I'm not dealing with the real person. When first John says that Messiah died as the atonement not only for us, but also as the atonement for the entire world, I now have to shift the source of Truth and shift my understanding of who gets to be the authority of what counts as a real person. Yeshua received all authority in heaven and on Earth, so he becomes the final authority on who a real person is. The truth, the true person is ontologically anchored in the human, Yeshua the Messiah now. This means Yeshua gets to be the ontological source of what a true person is or who the real person in front of me is. It doesn't matter if the person in front of me is a disciple or lost. All persons that are in front of me, the real them is now only found in and through the human Yeshua the Messiah. The gospel is the word becoming human, but also, the word reconstituting humanity through the incarnation, the cross and death, the resurrection and Ascension, and the descension at Pentecost into humanity of the word, Yeshua the Messiah.\n\nPractically this means I can reach for someone's heart when I see arrogance, and I can confidently say, this is not really you. There's fear here. I want to know the real you. The real you is worth knowing. This may not work the first time. This may not work the second time. This may not work the first 20 times. Some people, especially abused people, are especially committed to playing the role of the LIE. To the degree that you're having trouble breaking through, is proportional to the degree of the bear pain and suffering that they endured in trying to be human under their abuse. Some people's commitment to the LIE, in some areas of their life, are like four and a half feet high chain link fences, that you spit on your hands for and hop over. Some people's commitment to the LIE, are walls that appear to reach to the heavens. And this instance they may need to have a Jericho experience. And you may feel as stupid as Israelites commanded to wake up in the morning and March around and impenetrable City. But you can be confident that this is not the real person in front of you.\n\nIt may be maddening, it may cause you to doubt, their commitment to the role may be like the most eerie method actor you can imagine. You may be driven to the point of saying maybe there is no one else in there. You may entertain narratives that it is not the LIE, they are in fact this anger or this arrogance. But we have to understand that if we are driven to that point, we have to understand we are sinning not against just the person, but we have to understand we are sinning against Jesus Christ. We have to understand what we are saying is Yeshua is a lie, and he did not in fact die for all of humanity. Yeshua did not in fact stand in place for all of Adam. We are creating small print claws to go with our gospel, an exception clause that says Jesus represents all of humanity and reconstitutes them in himself, except for this one person who is especially arrogant. \n\nThis is not the time to entertain lies. That will only make their commitment stronger, and you will unwittingly be another voice that parallels their abuse. This is the time to be forceful, powerful and potent. This is the time to be immovably forward driving, indomitable. Continue with this kind of forcefulness saying this is not the real you, I want to know the real you. B a tank for the gospel. Deem Yeshua faithful. Know that when you move ahead saying this, he will not leave you or forsake you, his spirit his wind his new creation wings are hovering over this situation. Even if it is a situation that will take hours, days, weeks, months, years.","comments":[],"createdAt":"2025-05-16T14:28:43Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOMaqE1s8AAAACAXxCdg","name":"Ontology","description":"philosophy

Dynamic\t6\n\nGoal\nAs opposed to a dynamic translation which will be very fun to make in the future, we are going to be working on the Euphrates version. A dynamic translation is supposed to be poetical and still clever and higher prose . It is supposed to be a work of literature that makes entendres and linguistical Force of the source language available in the target language to readers.  In contrast we need a super simple, filled out version. I need to enumerate what I mean by filled out.  when I say filled out I actually am referring to supply information. What information is to be supplied in the Euphrates version? Simplified semantical background information that would make misinterpretation of the intended function in the source language impossible, or nearly impossible. There is a lot left to be said in peer-to-peer vernacular language. So much lies between the lines. Vernacular peer-to-peer communication by its very nature is intended to be constructed via consistent use of shorthand speech. While this is incredibly convenient for real time spoken peer-to-peer communication, this is problematic for reconstructing written language that is then to be enacted in a multidimensional complex context. Without supplying more semantical Source language background information, the space between the words will end up being supplied anachronistically through the eisegesis of the present-day listener.  therefore this version will necessarily be much longer. In the overly dyadic paradigm that dominates current biblical translation models, this will necessarily be termed as “Dynamic equivalence” . However a formal equivalence translation that is uncoupled with semantical study of the target language will necessarily lend its products to the blindly unscrutinizing anachronistic suppositions of the linguistically uninformed. Scribes are necessary.  scribes ought to be Servants of the  weak. The idea that ascribe would sit on an ivory Tower and use their higher levels of information to make the text more opaque and more inaccessible is satanic, demonic, and deserving of Wrath.  on the contrary, scribes are supposed to do the difficult dangerous highly skilled work of the ancient  miner. They are supposed to carefully climb and to unlit cracks that no man or beast travels into to find precious gems and bring them up safely to be shared and put in the hands of Toddlers and Solomon's kingdom.  Therefore the Euphrates translation  will be written in a prose that is simple enough for small children to understand. But it will be padded with supplied information in order to communicate the intended semantical thrust of the source language.    so from a pragmatic standpoint that would mean for every one sentence in the source language if we're going to create a philosophy of translation for the Euphrates version, it may require 8 to 12 sentences to appropriately translate and Harry in semantical information that is lacking in the source language. This is not paraphrase. This is additional, lexically commentating material. It will be subject to the subjectivity of me the translator. If the sentence is surprising, so too are all of the products of any translation philosophy subject to the translator. This is true whether one adults a theory of translation of formal equivalence or a theory of translation of dynamic equivalence. In fact the attempt to cite a theory of translation as a means of validating the product, is just another faint to hide the reality of the subjectivity of the translator. God is not ashamed of subjectivity. He has not entrusted his authority to a book. Is entrusted his authority to the human Messiah, and all of the tax collectors whores and losers that that Messiah has called himself.  However, there is Merit to questioning anyone's approach, including mine. There is Merit to questioning established approaches, so how much more when it comes to questioning Innovative and new approaches. I'm open to questioning. I myself have questions that are unanswered regarding this translation approach. Mainly what is a translation? Is mine a hybrid of translating and commentating? Has there ever been a translation that is not itself commentating? A word to word formal equivalents target language translation is an imaginary Impossible Dream. And yet, I am not hiding myself behind my translation and I want to be scrutinized as someone who is adding additional information. Is this a translation novel? Should we call it a creative work of literature? I'm open to it being called a creative work of literature, for so to are hymns and songs and spiritual  Psalms. The Holy Spirit has had no problem coupling with creativity. There is no threat to God by partnering with a creative human. I do not know what this translation is ontologically within the landscape of translation. Therefore let us move on and speak of the goals. The goal will be that a small girl with Down Syndrome with a light handle on pigeon talk would be readily able to step into a movie like internal visualization of the words being spoken and read to her. The goal will be more about the movie that she forms inside of her mind then about the exactitude of particular words in the translation itself. For this reason this translation is primarily an instrument like a vehicle, instead of an instrument that is likened to a destination. The destination will remain unseen, for it is intended to take place in the mind of a little girl Down syndrome. The goal will be that her mind movie will be just a semantically accurate and faithful to the ancient oracles as that generated by an erudite philological professor. \nDistinctives of this translation:\nThe word hiney, which means behold, or see, or hearken will be a metaphorical  Guiding Light for this translation. There will be inserted action words into our translation like Imagine This. This Will necessarily be redactive and intrusive, just as an instruction manual is intrusive to someone who is kinesthetically overcharged and impatient.  there will be overly supplied descriptors and descriptions that would necessarily step into the dangerous Zone of positing something that wasn't there in the first place:  eisegesis.  I actually want to mark my intrusive attempts at  eisegesis ( maybe I will do this with coloring or italics or some other textual formatting mechanism). \nIt is a mind movie manual; it is more like a script with production notes and attached storyboards. The script is a dynamical translation of the original. The supplied are the production notes and storyboard pictures and annotations.\nFull Text\nExodus\nExod 20:1 (THOT) וַיְדַבֵּר אֱלֹהִים אֵת כָּל־הַדְּבָרִים הָאֵלֶּה לֵאמֹֽר׃ס (NASB2020) Then God spoke all these words, saying, Exod 20:2 (THOT) אָֽנֹכִי יְהוָה אֱלֹהֶיךָ אֲשֶׁר הוֹצֵאתִיךָ מֵאֶרֶץ מִצְרַיִם מִבֵּית עֲבָדִיֽם׃ (NASB2020) “ I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery.

Depart from me, you who practice lawlessness or torahlessness!’ here the opposite of Torah-lessness, is torah**ful**ness\n- consider that the word used for surpass is actually used in physical quantity language and is translated as two super abound be left over or abound : Matthew 13:12 LEB For whoever has, to him more will be given, and he will have an **abundance**. But whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him.\n- therefore the translation should be to fill - up past the Pharisees\n- this brings up a very practical and simple question: through what means or mechanism or activity does Yeshua intend to bring Torah to its full unlacking state? through what activity does Yeshua intend to bring Torah abundance? the answer is simple through instructing and being an instructor. this is synonymous with being the messiah! the Messiah has come to bring Torah and to be the superlative best instructor. Christians have read this abstractly as having to do with sacrifice. the verse has nothing to do with Yeshua representatively dealing with death, sacrifice, punishment, retribution, or forgiveness. the verse has to do with him functioning as the Messiah, that is as an instructor instructing! this means he understood himself as doing the job to its maximum of instructing others on how to do Torah ! consider this passage in Matthew Matthew 23:8-10 LEB 8 But you are not to be called ‘Rabbi,’ because one is your teacher, and you are all brothers, 9 And do not call anyone your father on earth, for one is your heavenly Father. 10 And do not be called teachers, because one is your teacher, the Christ.Yeshua believed that the Messiah would take over the job of instructing the Torah, not getting rid of it. if he was getting rid of anything, it may be getting rid of the job of the scribes and the Pharisees by overtaking and subsuming their role.","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOMaqE1s6qfXlO","author":{"login":"joshualinog"},"authorAssociation":"OWNER","body":"### a very weird thought\n\nit is not a Christian idea that the Torah is not for gentiles. this is a thoroughly Jewish idea. it is the historical argument regarding the Torah that is age-old preceding Messiah by hundreds of years. the Torah is a privilege in the eyes of the Jewish people, and Gentiles are not invited to it.\n\nSoooooo....\n\nwhen you are arguing that the Torah is not for the Gentiles or they are not permitted to take part in torahfulness, you are advancing a pharisele, rabbinical argument. understand that the Messiah was gunning for their function as the soul instructor, and you are advancing the job security of the rabbinical movement and Pharisees by advocating for gentiles having no relationship to Torah. this is a pharisaical and rabbinical scribal argument.

Was John specifically simplifying isaanic thinking? Was John trying to articulate izanic concepts about the Messiah with simplicity? This seems to correlate with the idea that Isaiah itself is a convoluted obfuscated parabolic take in the vein of Deuteronomy 32 precisely because the clarity provided by the Torah and the Deuteronomy code of law is cast aside by Israel who prefers treachery and obfuscation.\n\nThere seem to be very odd keyword overlaps and vocabulary concepts that overlap with repeated usage in Isaiah.

All of you are kindlers of fire,  who gird yourselves with flaming arrows.  **Walk in the light of your fire,  and among the flaming arrows you have kindled**!  You shall have this from my hand:  you shall lie down in a place of torment.\n- Isaiah 49:6 LEB And he says, “It is trivial for you to be a servant for me,  to raise up the tribes of Jacob  and to bring back the preserved of Israel.  **I will give you as a light to the nations,  to be my salvation to the end of the earth.**”\n- Isaiah 42:6-7 LEB 6 “I am Yahweh; I have called you in righteousness,  and I have grasped your hand and watched over you;  and **I have given you as a covenant of the people,  as a light of the nations**, 7 to open the blind eyes,  to bring the prisoner out from the dungeon,  those who sit in darkness from the house of imprisonment.\n- Isaiah 51:4 LEB “Listen attentively to me, my people,  and my nation, listen to me!

Let it be done for you as you want.” And her daughter was healed from that hour.\n\n\n\nMatthew 15:29 And departing from there, Jesus went along the Sea of Galilee, and he went up on the mountain and was sitting there.\n\n\n\nMatthew 15:30 And large crowds came to him, having with them the mute, blind, lame, crippled, and many others, and they put them down at his feet, and he healed them.\n\n\n\nMatthew 15:31 So then the crowd was astonished when they saw the mute speaking, the crippled healthy, and the lame walking, and the blind seeing, and they praised the God of Israel.\n\n\n\nMatthew 15:32 And Jesus summoned his disciples and said, “I have compassion on the crowd, because they have remained with me three days already and do not have anything to eat, and I do not want to send them away hungry lest they give out on the way.”\n\n\n\nMatthew 15:33 And the disciples said to him, “Where in this desolate place can we get so much bread that such a great crowd could be satisfied?”\n\n\n\nMatthew 15:34 And Jesus said to them, “How many loaves do you have?” So they said, “Seven, and a few little fish.”\n\n\n\nMatthew 15:35 And commanding the crowd to recline for a meal on the ground,\n\n\n\nMatthew 15:36 he took the seven loaves and the fish and after he had given thanks, he broke them and began giving them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the crowds.\n\n\n\nMatthew 15:37 And they all ate and were satisfied, and they picked up what was left over of the broken pieces, seven baskets full.\n\n\n\nMatthew 15:38 Now those who ate were four thousand men, in addition to women and children.\n\n\n\nMatthew 15:39 And after he sent away the crowds, he got into the boat and went to the region of Magadan.\n\n\n\nMatthew 16:1 And when the Pharisees and Sadducees came to test him, they asked him to show them a sign from heaven.\n\n\n\nMatthew 16:2 So he answered and said to them, “When evening comes you say, ‘It will be fair weather because the sky is red,’\n\n\n\nMatthew 16:3 and early in the morning, ‘Today it will be stormy weather, because the sky is red and darkening.’ You know how to evaluate correctly the appearance of the sky, but you are not able to evaluate the signs of the times.\n\n\n\nMatthew 16:4 An evil and adulterous generation seeks for a sign, and a sign will not be given to it except the sign of Jonah!” And he left them and went away.\n\n\n\nMatthew 16:5 And when the disciples arrived at the other side, they had forgotten to take bread.\n\n\n\nMatthew 16:6 And Jesus said to them, “Watch out for and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees!”\n\n\n\nMatthew 16:7 So they were discussing this among themselves, saying, “It is because we did not take bread.”\n\n\n\nMatthew 16:8 But knowing this, Jesus said, “Why are you discussing among yourselves that you did not take bread, you of little faith?\n\n\n\nMatthew 16:9 Do you not yet understand or do you not remember the five loaves for the five thousand, and how many baskets you took up?\n\n\n\nMatthew 16:10 Or the seven loaves for the four thousand and how many baskets you took up?\n\n\n\nMatthew 16:11 How do you not understand that I did not speak to you about bread?

For instance the father mother children language would just be applied again to larger macrocosmic subcomponents of said space or orbit.","comments":[],"createdAt":"2025-01-27T16:57:15Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOMaqE1s8AAAABr-NFOA","name":"﹖.ᐣ❔🔎 🕵🏻 QUESTION","description":"Further information is requested","color":"444BD4"},{"id":"LA_kwDOMaqE1s8AAAACPIjhJQ","name":"isPost","description":"Issue represents a post","color":"ffffff"}],"number":13,"state":"OPEN","title":"Is the most basic definition of a house synonymous with the components of a house of name?","updatedAt":"2025-11-07T21:08:17Z"},{"assignees":[],"body":"Leviticus 8:22-29 HB2 22 8:22 וַיַּקְרֵב אֶת־הָאַיִל הַשֵּׁנִי אֵיל הַמִּלֻּאִים וַיִּסְמְכוּ אַהֲרֹן וּבָנָיו אֶת־יְדֵיהֶם עַל־רֹאשׁ הָאָיִל: \n\n23 8:23 וַיִּשְׁחָט וַיִּקַּח מֹשֶׁה מִדָּמוֹ וַיִּתֵּן עַל־תְּנוּךְ אֹזֶן־אַהֲרֹן הַיְמָנִית וְעַל־בֹּהֶן יָדוֹ הַיְמָנִית וְעַל־בֹּהֶן רַגְלוֹ הַיְמָנִית: \n\n24 8:24 וַיַּקְרֵב אֶת־בְּנֵי אַהֲרֹן וַיִּתֵּן מֹשֶׁה מִן־הַדָּם עַל־תְּנוּךְ אָזְנָם הַיְמָנִית וְעַל־בֹּהֶן יָדָם הַיְמָנִית וְעַל־בֹּהֶן רַגְלָם הַיְמָנִית וַיִּזְרֹק מֹשֶׁה אֶת־הַדָּם עַל־הַמִּזְבֵּחַ סָבִיב: \n\n25 8:25 וַיִּקַּח אֶת־הַחֵלֶב וְאֶת־הָאַלְיָה וְאֶת־כָּל־הַחֵלֶב אֲשֶׁר עַל־הַקֶּרֶב וְאֵת יֹתֶרֶת הַכָּבֵד וְאֶת־שְׁתֵּי הַכְּלָיֹת וְאֶת־חֶלְבְּהֶן וְאֵת שׁוֹק הַיָּמִין: \n\n26 8:26 וּמִסַּל הַמַּצּוֹת אֲשֶׁר לִפְנֵי יְהוָה לָקַח חַלַּת מַצָּה אַחַת וְחַלַּת לֶחֶם שֶׁמֶן אַחַת וְרָקִיק אֶחָד וַיָּשֶׂם עַל־הַחֲלָבִים וְעַל שׁוֹק הַיָּמִין: \n\n27 8:27 וַיִּתֵּן אֶת־הַכֹּל עַל כַּפֵּי אַהֲרֹן וְעַל כַּפֵּי בָנָיו וַיָּנֶף אֹתָם תְּנוּפָה לִפְנֵי יְהוָה: \n\n28 8:28 וַיִּקַּח מֹשֶׁה אֹתָם מֵעַל כַּפֵּיהֶם וַיַּקְטֵר הַמִּזְבֵּחָה עַל־הָעֹלָה מִלֻּאִים הֵם לְרֵיחַ נִיחֹחַ אִשֶּׁה הוּא לַיהוָה: \n\n29 8:29 וַיִּקַּח מֹשֶׁה אֶת־הֶחָזֶה וַיְנִיפֵהוּ תְנוּפָה לִפְנֵי יְהוָה מֵאֵיל הַמִּלֻּאִים לְמֹשֶׁה הָיָה לְמָנָה כַּאֲשֶׁר צִוָּה יְהוָה אֶת־מֹשֶׁה:\n\nMatthew 9:1-38 LEB 1 And getting into a boat, he crossed over and came to his own town. 2 And behold, they brought to him a paralytic lying on a stretcher, and when Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, “Have courage, child, your sins are forgiven.” 3 And behold, some of the scribes said to themselves, “This man is blaspheming!” 4 And knowing their thoughts, Jesus said, “Why do you think evil in your hearts? 5 For which is easier to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Get up and walk’? 6 But in order that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins,” then he said to the paralytic, “Get up, pick up your stretcher and go to your home.” 7 And he got up and went to his home. 8 But when the crowds saw this, they were afraid and glorified God who had given such authority to men. 9 And as Jesus was going away from there, he saw a man called Matthew sitting at the tax booth and said to him, “Follow me!” And he stood up and followed him. 10 And it happened as he was dining in the house, behold, many tax collectors and sinners were coming and dining with Jesus and his disciples. 11 And when they saw it, the Pharisees began to say to his disciples, “Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?” 12 And when he heard it, he said, “Those who are healthy do not have need of a physician, but those who are sick. 13 But go and learn what it means, “I want mercy and not sacrifice.” For I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners.” 14 Then the disciples of John approached him, saying, “Why do we and the Pharisees fast often, but your disciples do not fast?” 15 And Jesus said to them, “The bridegroom’s attendants are not able to mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them. But days are coming when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast. 16 But no one puts a patch of unshrunken cloth on an old garment, for its patch pulls away from the garment, and the tear becomes worse. 17 Nor do they put new wine into old wineskins. Otherwise the wineskins burst and the wine is spilled, and the wineskins are destroyed. But they put new wine into new wineskins and both are preserved.” 18 As he was saying these things to them, behold, one of the rulers came and knelt down before him, saying, “My daughter has just now died, but come, place your hand on her and she will live!” 19 And Jesus and his disciples got up and followed him. 20 And behold, a woman who had been suffering with a hemorrhage twelve years approached from behind and touched the edge of his cloak, 21 for she said to herself, “If only I touch his cloak I will be healed.” 22 But Jesus, turning around and seeing her, said, “Have courage, daughter! Your faith has healed you.” And the woman was healed from that hour. 23 And when Jesus came into the ruler’s house and saw the flute players and the disorderly crowd, 24 he said, “Go away, because the girl is not dead, but is sleeping.” And they ridiculed him. 25 But when the crowd had been sent out, he entered and took her hand, and the girl got up. 26 And this report went out into that whole region. 27 And as Jesus was going away from there, two blind men followed him, crying out and saying, “Have mercy on us, Son of David!” 28 And when he came into the house, the blind men approached him, and Jesus said to them, “Do you believe that I am able to do this?” They said to him, “Yes, Lord.” 29 Then he touched their eyes, saying, “According to your faith let it be done for you.” 30 And their eyes were opened, and Jesus sternly warned them, saying, “See that no one finds out.” 31 But they went out and spread the report about him in that whole region. 32 Now as they were going away, behold, they brought to him a demon-possessed man who was unable to speak. 33 And after the demon had been expelled, the one who had been mute spoke, and the crowds were astonished, saying, “This has never been seen before in Israel!” 34 But the Pharisees were saying, “By the ruler of demons he expels the demons!” 35 And Jesus was going around all the towns and the villages, teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the good news of the kingdom and healing every disease and every sickness. 36 And when he saw the crowds, he had compassion for them, because they were weary and dejected, like sheep that did not have a shepherd. 37 Then he said to his disciples, “The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few. 38 Therefore ask the Lord of the harvest that he send out workers into his harvest.”","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOMaqE1s6cs1m2","author":{"login":"joshualinog"},"authorAssociation":"OWNER","body":"-Gideon bizarre reading of mourning & bridegroom\n- Temple destroyed, fasting turned to feasting, Zechariah,\n- Josh gives reading vs 14 disciples of Moses, John 9, disciples of John and disciples of the Pharisees","createdAt":"2025-02-01T15:39:41Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/joshualinog/scribal.bible-CONTENT-CREATION/issues/12#issuecomment-2628999606","viewerDidAuthor":true}],"createdAt":"2025-01-26T20:17:32Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOMaqE1s8AAAACPIjhJQ","name":"isPost","description":"Issue represents a post","color":"ffffff"}],"number":12,"state":"OPEN","title":"Leviticus 8.22-29 ; Matthew 9.1-36 ( Public Reading )","updatedAt":"2025-11-07T21:08:16Z"},{"assignees":[{"id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4Mzk2MDM=","login":"joshualinog","name":"Joshua Andrew Linog"}],"body":"","comments":[],"createdAt":"2025-01-25T16:54:43Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOMaqE1s8AAAABr-NFOA","name":"﹖.ᐣ❔🔎 🕵🏻 QUESTION","description":"Further information is requested","color":"444BD4"},{"id":"LA_kwDOMaqE1s8AAAACPIjhJQ","name":"isPost","description":"Issue represents a post","color":"ffffff"}],"number":11,"state":"OPEN","title":"is the local synagogue a micro protrusion that is itself an emergent micro instantiation of the whole reality ? a kind of mandelbrot protrusion that reflects the larger structure it is subsumed in and part of?","updatedAt":"2025-11-07T21:08:15Z"},{"assignees":[{"id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4Mzk2MDM=","login":"joshualinog","name":"Joshua Andrew Linog"}],"body":"Like from Sinai centered and high up, to lower ground level radially spread out and dispersing","comments":[],"createdAt":"2025-01-25T16:34:44Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOMaqE1s8AAAABr-NFOA","name":"﹖.ᐣ❔🔎 🕵🏻 QUESTION","description":"Further information is requested","color":"444BD4"},{"id":"LA_kwDOMaqE1s8AAAACPIjhJQ","name":"isPost","description":"Issue represents a post","color":"ffffff"}],"number":10,"state":"OPEN","title":"Is s2O4 an altitude radial model of spreading/dispersion?","updatedAt":"2025-11-07T21:08:13Z"},{"assignees":[{"id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4Mzk2MDM=","login":"joshualinog","name":"Joshua Andrew Linog"}],"body":"","comments":[],"createdAt":"2025-01-25T16:32:03Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOMaqE1s8AAAABr-NFOA","name":"﹖.ᐣ❔🔎 🕵🏻 QUESTION","description":"Further information is requested","color":"444BD4"},{"id":"LA_kwDOMaqE1s8AAAACPIjhJQ","name":"isPost","description":"Issue represents a post","color":"ffffff"}],"number":9,"state":"OPEN","title":"Is synagogue eyes and hands and feet?
