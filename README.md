## why this project exists

This repository contains the website and templates for the Scribal Bible project.

## how to contribute to and interact with scribal Bible
- Just read, browse, and ponder.
- Use Issues as a conversation launchpad — add comments with multimedia (video, photos, text, audio).
- When assigned an issue, treat it as an invitation to contribute or comment; questions are welcome.

## Terminal & SSH notes

- Open a terminal per-folder in VS Code: right-click the desired folder in the Explorer and choose "Open in Integrated Terminal" so commands run in the intended repository.
- This workspace is configured to use SSH remotes. Ensure your SSH key is loaded (example): `ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_codespace`.
- To run a command against the other repo without switching folders, use explicit paths or git/npm prefixes, e.g. `git -C /workspaces/content-creation-scribal-bible status` or `npm --prefix /workspaces/scribal.bible run build`.

If you'd like, I can add these notes to a `CONTRIBUTING.md` or a top-level docs file instead.
