  "content": "where is the lexically based proof that Gad Means good fortune in Genesis 30.11 ? where is the word ever used in the tanach where it should be translated Good Fortune? it is always a name, or seems to always be likely connected to its root which means to invade or attack. consider Genesis 49.19. additionally consider the vitriol in Rachel's naming of Dan and naftali, aimed at Leah. it seems more likely that gad has his name because he is yet another son that is from Leah invading her sister. another play on words is that it means troop, and he is now her fifth son, albeit through zilpah\n\nGenesis 49:19\nHB2 49:19 גָּד גְּדוּד יְגוּדֶנּוּ וְהוּא יָגֻד עֲקֵבָם:\nYLT Gad! a troop assaulteth him, But he assaulteth last.\nLEB Bandits shall attack Gad, but he shall attack their heels.",
