Immersion in water the beginning of the day, and rising anew. Baptism is the start of the day. \n- the connection of the idea his hour had not come tracking the movement of the Sun in 12 hours of daylight / John 11:9-10 LEB 9 Jesus replied, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If anyone walks around in the daylight, he does not stumble, because he sees the light of this world. 10 But if anyone walks around in the night, he stumbles, because the light is not in him.\n- the 12 tribes on the priestly breastplate moving from east to west \n- Revelation  21:23 LEB And the city has no need of the sun or of the moon, that they shine on it, for the glory of God illuminates it, and its lamp is the Lamb.\n\n\n## passages \nPsalms 113:3\nHB2 113:3 מִמִּזְרַח־שֶׁמֶשׁ עַד־מְבוֹאוֹ מְהֻלָּל שֵׁם יְהוָה:\nYLT From the rising of the sun unto its going in, Praised is the name of Jehovah.\nLEB From the rising of the sun to its setting, let the name of Yahweh be blessed.",
