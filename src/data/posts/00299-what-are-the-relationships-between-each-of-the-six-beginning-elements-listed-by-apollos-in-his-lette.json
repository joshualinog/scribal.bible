Function and functionary? \n- [ ] why do each of the first listed in the pair have to do with death? \n\n## passages\n\nHebrews 6:1-2 LEB 1 Therefore, leaving behind the elementary message about Christ, let us move on to maturity, not laying again a foundation of\n\n1.  repentance from dead works and\n2.  faith in God, \n3. teaching about baptisms\n4.  and laying on of hands, \n5. and resurrection of the dead \n6. and eternal judgment.\n\nHebrews 6:1-2 LEB 1 Therefore, leaving behind the elementary message about Christ, let us move on to maturity, not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works and faith in God, 2 teaching about baptisms and laying on of hands, and resurrection of the dead and eternal judgment.\n\n",
