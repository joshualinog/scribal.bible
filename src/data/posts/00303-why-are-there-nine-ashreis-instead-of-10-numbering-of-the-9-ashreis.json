  "content": "# Why are there nine ashreis instead of 10? Numbering of the 9 ashreis?\nYeshua is the glory on the mountain speaking to his 12 tribes giving them his Torah from heaven for life. Why are there only nine of these words? Where is the 10th? Should they not be numbered by the presence of blessed?\n\n\n\n Matthew 5:1-12 LEB 1 Now when he saw the crowds, he went up the mountain and after he sat down, his disciples approached him. 2 And opening his mouth he began to teach them, saying, \n\n3 “**Blessed _1_** are the poor in spirit,  ~~because 1~~ theirs is the kingdom of heaven. \n\n4 **Blessed _2_** are the ones who mourn,  ~~because 2~~ they will be comforted. \n\n5 **Blessed _3_** are the meek,  ~~because 3~~ they will inherit the earth. \n\n6 **Blessed _4_** are the ones who hunger and thirst for righteousness,  ~~because 4~~ they will be satisfied. \n\n7 **Blessed _5_** are the merciful,  ~~because 5~~ they will be shown mercy. \n\n8 **Blessed _6_** are the pure in heart,  ~~because 6~~ they will see God. \n\n9 **Blessed _7_** are the peacemakers,  ~~because 7~~ they will be called sons of God. \n\n10 **Blessed _8_** are those who are persecuted because of righteousness,  ~~because 8~~ theirs is the kingdom of heaven. \n\n11 **Blessed _9_** are you  when they insult you and persecute you and say all kinds of evil things against you, lying on account of me. 12 Rejoice and be glad, ~~because 9~~ your reward is great in heaven, for in the same way they persecuted the prophets before you.",
