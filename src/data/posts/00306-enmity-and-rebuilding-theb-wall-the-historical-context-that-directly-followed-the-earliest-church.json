According to a reconstructed inscription found on the site, \"the emperor Vespasian ordered this new amphitheatre to be erected from his general's share of the booty.\" It is often assumed, as it is with many other Roman projects at the time, that slaves and prisoners of war were brought back to Rome and contributed to the massive workforce needed for the construction of the amphitheater.[19] \"\n https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colosseum#:~:text=Construction%20was%20funded,%5B19%5D",
