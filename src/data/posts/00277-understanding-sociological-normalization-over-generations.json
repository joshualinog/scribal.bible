  "content": "Consider the societal normalization of certain conditions and arrangements that are in fact novel. Consider a line of socratic questioning \n\nCan humans devise arrangements and setups that are harmful for humans? \nIf the answer is yes can these harmful arrangements become the generationally normalized? Was human sacrifice normalized in chiapas and other coastal Mexican planes areas and medieval periods? \nOnce normalized, can these societal arrangements being perceived as negative become a more difficult achievement from the perspective of the one arranged in calling it normal? Is it a difficult task because it creates cognitive dissonance in the one who is entrenched and trying to determine if their own normal is in fact harmful? \n\n\n",
