  "content": "# creation is a low Act beneath God requiring an emptying / Kenosis which is itself an embodiment\n\nCreating is beneath GOD. it is an an act that itself requires stooping, deigning, kenosis to perform it.\n\nIN RELATION TO GOD,\nall creation ( any part of it examined, or all of it extant) is  a _finite lesser bounded/[read_embodied_] object_\n\n\ncreating (any one thing ever or all things ever) requires touching/ interfacing with lesser/definite/bounded object.\n\nTo create required an emptying = the act of creating (a finite lesser object) requires GOD to stoop to interface and bring into being\n\n\ncreation, both the heavens and the earth are called God's garments, God's clothing\n\nThis begs a question? Does God have a \"body\" to put the clothing on? \n\nI argue here that the very act of CREATING was an act of embodiment of sorts.\n\n\n\nThus GOD \"embodied\" himself to create. His creation is his clothing ( to Cover his nakedness) . This nakedness we can call his \"glory\". We can also call this naked embodiment his IMAGE, or said differently : the IMAGE OF GOD.\n\nThe Torah, Targums, and NT calls this embodiment The WORD.",
