  "content": "- 1 John 3:2 LEB Dear friends, now we are children of God, and **what we will be has not yet been revealed**. We know that whenever he is **revealed we will be like him, because we will see him just as he is**.\n- Exodus 34 and Moshe not knowing what he will be like but reflecting Yahweh by being in his presence \n     - Exodus 34:29-30 LEB 29 And when Moses came down from Mount Sinai, the two tablets of the testimony were in the hand of Moses at his coming down from the mountain; and Moses did not know that the skin of his face shone because of his speaking with him. 30 And Aaron and all the Israelites saw Moses, and, to their amazement, the skin of his face shone, and they were afraid of coming near to him.\n- Stephen through the Holy Spirit beholding the face of Jesus looking like an angel and audibly uttering seeing Jesus in the clouds before being killed \n- Pauline apostolic directives regarding ceaseless prayer aimed at the Holy Spirit of Jesus inside the conscience so that a resultant reflecting in degrees of Glory occurs. This reflection of Glory could have a functional aspect in Pauline thinking such that those who reflect the glory of the Messiah and degrees will be the ones who will be selected to remain behind rather than those who will be taken away \n",
