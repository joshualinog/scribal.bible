The Palestinian triennial reading cycle?\n     - list a table of the reconstructed Palestinian triennial readings from the article The Reading of the Law and Prophets in a Triennial Cycle by rabbi Adolf Büchler. \n- is there any evidence that the Babylonian rabbis tried to keep intact the apportioning of the triennial sedarim when they innovated the annual parashot?\n     - is it possible that the rabbis already had an annual reading cycle that they considered was more advanced and used for rabbis or disciples of rabbis? This is speculation, but it would map onto their concept of attaining more regular levels of piety via challenge\n- is there any evidence that the ancient triennial cycle portions were already mapping on to the specific prophet passages that would formally be attached to them in the haftarah of the annual Babylonian cycle?\n\n\n## key examples \n- 1 Thessalonians and Parashat Beshalach / בְּשַׁלַּח Exodus 13:17-17:16\n ",
