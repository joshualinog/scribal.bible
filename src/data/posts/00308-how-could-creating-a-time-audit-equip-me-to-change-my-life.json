  "content": "# How could creating a time audit equip me to change my life?\n- [ ] help me to see the weakness of my memory\n- [ ] help me to see \"me\" as a continuous person backwards, even if the present me feels more real to me (e.g. can I have compassion for my past self? Can I dishonor my past self? What is the relationship of me to me on a timeline?)\n- [ ] help me to see where meaningfulness that will express later is truly being worked on in the present\n- [ ] help me to see where meaninglessness is happening in my choices because meaningfulness can't express later as a result of the presently meaningless actions I've taken\n- [ ] help me to see how little time I have left for multi phased long term goals that can't be rushed OR dropped and pcked back up later (e.g. growing a tropical fruit tree from seed in zone 8, training/raising up a righteous child)\n\n## how do you make a time audit? \n\n1. write out everything you did (be detailed. The more detailed the better) for a specific span of time (An hour, half a day, a day, a week, a month ; a week with daily details is the most doable with details but a month is better for increased usefulness of the time audit) \n- for memory's sake ask yourself **HOW MANY TIMES DID I...**: \n- eat? \n- prepare and drink water?\n- prepare and drink other drinks?\n- go fetch items for drinks and food (include grocery shops but also include going to fridge)\n- prepare, Cook food?\n- clean up after food? \n- clean up for some other reason? What reason? \n- go to the bathroom? \n- have sex? \n- clothe myself? \n- look for clothes? \n- Wash dry fold put away clothes?\n- rearrange storage of clothes?\n- get more clothes? \n- fix, build on, rearrange, clean living space/ house? Why? Which parts of living space? \n- work garden, yard, land? Which parts? Why? \n- do/work produce and income jobs? Sell things, work things to produce return of Earth (work to produce a return of tools (money is a tool), jobs, land, housing, clothing, water food)? Why\n- create art/arranged-Earthscapes to memorialize beauty in your life? Why? Why not? \n- FaceTime a spouse? A child? A house mate? A synagogue mate?? A temple mate? A kin with duty relative? A lost person or person in community? Particularly POOWAD?\n# **GONNA WORK ON THIS LIST OF QUESTIONS MORE**\n\n\n## what is a time audit?",
