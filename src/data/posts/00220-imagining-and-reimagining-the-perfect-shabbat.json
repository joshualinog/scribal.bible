  "content": "# overview \n## questions \n- does the rest envisioned in Shabbat constitute a summons away from making requests, and a call towards giving thanks for what we've already received or accomplished? \n- is it wrong try to use Shabbat to dream of Eden and imagine the perfect world? \n- is it wrong to make requests on Shabbat? \n- would it be wrong to try to dream of Eden in the week to come, on Shabbat? \n- is Shabbat aimed at the past, present, or future? Or bits of all three?\n## concepts \n- I believe the perfect world and Shabbat are connected concepts. I believe Shabbat should be the manifestation of edenic perfection, the manifestation of Eden restored. The opposite of the House of slavery. Almost a break from the seen world imperfections to experience heaven's perfection.",
